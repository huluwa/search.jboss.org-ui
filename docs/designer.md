# Designer Instructions

## Available Stubs

### Search Results

Found at [index.html](./../searchPage/src/main/webapp/design/search_results/index.html).

It contains stub of the main `index.html` page with basic structure of the main HTML elements, specifically the top menu with logo, search field and filter buttons.

Then it contains element with search results and pagination. Normally, the page with search results contains ten individual results (if there are enough results available). In this stub there are only three items.

Note that the stub `index.html` contains links to all CSS files but many of them are commented out. This is because they do not contribute to any of the visible elements on the stub but I decided not to delete them in case you feel like exploring them as well.

This stub should be used to tune design of **search results** (or try experimenting with them). It is not much useful for tuning of the top part of the screen (search field and filter button). It can be, however, used for **logo design** experiments.
